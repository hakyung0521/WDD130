                <summary> How to Temper Chocolate? </summary>
                <p class="text">
                    <br>
                    I assume you don’t have a giant chocolate tempering machine around, but don’t let that stop you. Here’s the easiest way to temper chocolate. It’s fun and relaxing and takes about 20 minutes until the chocolate is ready for molding, dipping, drizzling, or enrobing.
                    There are a number of chocolate tempering methods, but what follows is called seeding. You cheat by adding finely chopped, already tempered chocolate to a bowl of melted chocolate. Then you stir, and the tempered chocolate “seeds” the melted chocolate with the desirable cocoa butter crystal shape. 
                    For this method to work, you need at least 4 ounces of chocolate that’s still in temper. If you’re re-melting chocolate that’s bloomed, you’ll need to make sure to buy some tempered chocolate for seeding.    </p>

                <summary> How to Fold a Burrito? </summary>
                <p class="text">
                <br> 1. Warm the tortillas before folding. Larger, slightly warmed tortillas are much easier to fold and they are also less likely to crack or tear. Aim to use a 10-inch flour tortilla or larger. Warm it by placing it in a hot skillet for about 30 seconds on each side or microwave it for about 20 seconds.
                <br> 2. Don't place the filling right in the middle. Place the filling just a little bit closer to you on the tortilla versus it being right in the middle. Don’t bring it all the way to the end, but visualize the tortilla in quarters and place it about three-quarters away from the furthest end.
                <br> 3. Think of the steps as occurring almost simultaneously. While a step-by-step process shows you to fold in the ends and then fold up the burrito, these steps are really somewhat simultaneous. As you fold in the ends, immediately roll the filling inside as you continue to keep those tucked ends in their place while you work.
                <br> 4. Use a bit of guacamole or mayo to seal the ends. I like to spread very thin layer of guacamole or sriracha mayonnaise on the far end of the tortilla to help seal the end of the burrito. But don’t add so much that it squishes out the seam!

                <p class="text">
                    <br>How To Scrub Your Pots and Pans Using Salt 
                    <br>
                    <br>Let's say I have a Dutch oven with burnt, stuck-on food around the outer edges. I start by washing it with a soapy sponge and water. If it has stuck-on bits that won’t scrub off easily, I rinse it and pour out the water—excess water will dissolve the salt quickly, which I don’t want. 
                    I sprinkle a tablespoon of coarse salt all over and rub it in circles with the sponge using the same amount of pressure as I do when washing with soap and water. The salt acts as a mild abrasive. 
                    Once the salt dissolves and I no longer feel or see it, I rinse the pot and check to see if I need to repeat the process, but usually once or twice is enough. I give the pot one last quick wash and rinse. That’s it!.
