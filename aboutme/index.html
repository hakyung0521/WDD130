        <p> Hello! My name is Sophie Kim. 
            My Korean name is difficult to pronounce, so you can call me Sophie.
            I'm from South Korea. 
            South Korea is a beautiful country. 
            I hope you travel to South Korea in the future.
            My major is Data Science. 
            I like to take pictures, listen to music, watch movies and K-drama, travel new places, and cook delicious food. <p>

        <p> I have one sister, and my first nephew was born 4 months ago in the US. 
            He is so cute and adorable.
            I'm so glad and happy to be an aunt.</p>
